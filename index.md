About
=====

iWCT-GraphX-algorithm is a project __aimed at implementing graph algorithms upon Apache Spark and GraphX__. The project is a subsidiary of [SJTU-iWCT-Spark](http://spark.sjtu.edu.cn) which also researches in Big Data and Spark MLlib.

Note: The website you are viewing is realized with [MDwiki](http://mdwiki.info) and hosted on GitHub [sjtu-iwct/graphx-webpage](https://github.com/sjtu-iwct/graphx-webpage). The algorithm source codes are hosted on GitHub [sjtu-iwct/graphx-algorithm](https://github.com/sjtu-iwct/graphx-algorithm). They are both open source projects and need your [contribution](contribute.md).
